Resurrect

Resurrect reopens your last deleted buffers. When you delete a buffer Resurrect
adds it to a list of recently closed buffers and you can then use :Resurrect to
reopen the last closed buffer. Repeated calls to :Resurrect will work through
the list reopening each buffer in reverse historical order. The behaviour is
designed to be as similar as possible to the way modern browsers reopen last
closed tabs.

Why not...?

<C-^>

Pressing <C-^> will open the alternative file, which is often the buffer that
was just deleted. But repeated presses will just toggle between the two, not
open earlier files. Also the alternative file is not always the last buffer, it
depends on the language.

Most recently used plugins.

Plugins such as mru.vim and mru provide easy access to the most recently opened
files, but this is not the most recently closed files, and is not as quick to
just reopen.
